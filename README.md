# My React Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of my work showcasing my skills and talents using React.

In this application:
- a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer is presented when loaded.
- the header has the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading is presented and that title is highlighted when a navigation title is clicked.
- the About Me title and section are selected by default.
- a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them is in the About Me section.
- titled images of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository are in the Portfolio section.
- a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message is in the Contact section.
- a notification that this field is required shows when the user clicks out of one of the form fields without entering text.
- a notification is received if the user has entered an invalid email address after trying to submit the form.
- a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies are in the Resume section.
- icon links to the developer’s GitHub, LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, Email, and Phone Number are in the footer.
